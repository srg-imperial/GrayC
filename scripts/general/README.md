# Download compilers source 

GrayC works with compiler source code. To download LLVM:
```
./1-download-llvm.sh <base-folder> <version>
```
and GCC:
```
./1-download-gcc.sh <base-folder> <version>
```

We recommend using swap files when building from source of these compilers.

The current version of LLVM tested is LLVM-15.

# Scripts of GrayC

We are preparing a set of README files for the scripts that are part of GrayC. We update below which folders are ready to use.

- general: contains scripts to get LLVM and GCC source code.
- LLVM-Test-suite-coverage: scripts were specifically written to the LLVM code base for downloading the LLVM test suites or parts of it and to measure coverage.

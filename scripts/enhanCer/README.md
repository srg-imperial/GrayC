# enhanCer

The enhanCer is a set of scripts that are part of GrayC. It has two main functionalities:
 
- The first takes a program and injects Csmith function calls thus the resultant program prints checksum in the end.
 
- The other takes a fuzzed program that hits new coverage and transforms it into a small test for the LLVM test suite.

Scripts here are either starting with (1-) or (2-) according to which functionality the perform.
